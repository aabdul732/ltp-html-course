<h4>Java for Beginners: Writing Your First Program</h4>
        <p>Welcome. If this is your first time programming, congratulations! Youâ€™re 
about to start an adventure that most find very rewarding. If you are trying to learn after a previous abortive attempt, you deserve recognition as well. Tackling programming isnâ€™t always easyâ€”but itâ€™s not outside the grasp of the average person, either.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Iâ€™ve taught programming to over 500,000 people both online and in person. The programmers Iâ€™ve met over the yearsâ€”both beginners and seasoned vetsâ€”have come from a variety of backgrounds. Iâ€™ve found that both PhDs and high school dropouts can make good programmers. Iâ€™ve had mathematicians, psychiatrists, and 12 year-olds in my classes over the years and all have been able to learn some programming.</p>
        <p>You will learn too. In this introductory chapterâ€”which is specially designed for the slightly apprehensive beginnerâ€”I am going to take you step-by-step through the process of writing your first program. You donâ€™t need any special equipment except a laptop or desktop computer.</p>
        <p>So without further delay, letâ€™s get started!</p>
